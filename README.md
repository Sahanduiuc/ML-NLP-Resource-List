# ML-NLP-Resource-List
The purpose of this repo is to provide information / links to people, papers, projects, and code involving using novel data methods, ML, NLP, etc. in government.

This is in very early stages! Please reach out to inquiries@xd.gov OR christian.l.moscardi@census.gov -- or, just go ahead and submit a Pull Request -- if you've got anything that you'd like to be added to this list.
